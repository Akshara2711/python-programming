You are designing a simple user management system for a school.

Create a base class User to store common details like username and email.

Create a class Student that inherits from User and also stores the student's roll number and a list of enrolled courses.

Create a class Teacher that inherits from User and also stores the teacher's employee ID and a list of subjects they teach.

Write a program to:

Create one Student and one Teacher object with sample data.

Display all the details of both objects clearly.







# list=[1,2,3,4,5]
# list.append(6)
# print(list)




# rows=5
# for i in range(1,6):
#    i=i+1
#    print(rows,i+1)
# #    print(i)


# rows=1
# i=1
# print(i)
# print(rows,i+1)


# Class Bankaccount:
#       def __init__(self):
#       self.accountholder=accountholder
#       self.blance=blance

# # b1=Bankaccount(self.account)
# # b1.add(deposit)
# # b1.checkbalance
# Class Customer(Bankaccount):
#        def __get__(self.deposit,blancecheck):
#        self.deposit=deposit
#        se
